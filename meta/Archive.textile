h1. Archive

This database provides the proper information structure to allow for proper archival organization of events-based items.

It offers, at the very bottom, an organization in which one may identify uploads with users.

h2. Special entries

One event, with @id = 0, name = "General"@, would always exist to allow for the addition of collections which do not belong to an event.

h2. Relationships

* @Event@      belongsTo @Event@
* @Collection@ belongsTo @Event@
* @Item@       belongsTo @Collection@
* @Comment@    belongsTo @Item@

h3. Collection

A Collection is merely a (chrono)logical grouping of events (sub-Collections) and/or albums.

The criteria which distinguish an Event from a Collection is a flag, @is_event@, which the user can turn on or off.
